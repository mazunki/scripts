# Scripts

This is a repository of scripts I use as one-shots or as a solid addition to my toolkit. Most of them are sh-based, but that's not necessarily so.

This repository is set up under `~/.local/bin` on my system, and this directory is under my user `$PATH`.
```sh
git clone git@github.com:mazunki/scripts.git ~/.local/bin
export PATH="${HOME/.local/bin}:${PATH}"
```
It's quite handy.

Also, make sure these scripts are `chmod +x scriptname`'d so you can actually execute them.

Use at your own risk. Pull requests, suggestions, and reports are welcome! :3
