# Do you just want to know the coordinates of the window you're working on?
# Perhaps so you can take a screenshot... or know its size?
# 
# Usage:
#	wl-select-active [--verbose]
# If you add the verbose option, you'll also see the name of the application as the third column
# If you only want the name, consider `wl-select-active --verbose | cut -d' ' -f3-`
#	TODO: Maybe add this as a `--only-name` option?
# 
# 
# Dependencies:
# - Compatible with sway, or any other compositor which provides a swaymsg interface
# - jq, a JSON parser
# 
# Consider the following for your sway bindings
#	bindsym $mod+o exec grim -g "$(wl-select-active)" - | wl-copy
#
